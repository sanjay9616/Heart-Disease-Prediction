# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this project I build a machine learning system that can predict a person whether heart disease or not

● We need a heart data set parametes which contains several health parameters.</br>
● We need to process data set into our machine learning algorithms.</br>
● Once processed the data set we need to split data set into training data and testing data because we trained the algorithm using training data and this split dataset is called train test split.</br>
● We need to feed the data to our machine learning model, In this phase I am going to used a logistic regression model because this binay classifier.</br>
● once we trained the logistic regression model with the training data after that we will get a trained logistic regression model.</br>
● When we processed a new to data to our trained logistic model our model can predict that the person is heart disease or not
